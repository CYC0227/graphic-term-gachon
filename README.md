# Ghost Maze Runner 
This is a Gachon University computer graphics term project.
## Info
This game is about escaping the maze by avoiding ghosts.<br>
Your character starts at the starting point. <br>
Ghosts are wandering in the middle of the maze. <br>
If you can't avoid the ghost, your character's speed will be slow down. If you encounter a ghost twice, it will be game over.<br>
Let's escape the maze by avoiding the ghosts!<br>

## Technology
WebGL (Babylon.js)

## References
We made a game with reference to [spacy-lookups-data](https://github.com/To-Fujita/Babylon.js_3D_Graphics) 


## Feature

### 1. Character motion
Our game's player and monsters (ghosts) form a lively screen because they move their arms, legs, and bodies on the move.<br>
This is because we only selected the ones with motion when choosing a model.<br>

### 2. Light
We paid attention to the treatment of the light source. <br>
Since the game has a scary atmosphere, it has a dark background overall and only shoots light around the player, further enhancing the gameability.<br>

### 3. The fun of games
Our game paid attention not only to cool graphics but also to the fun of the game.<br>
Players cannot freely pass through the walls of the maze, but ghosts do not.<br>
You can have a thrilling experience due to a ghost that suddenly appears between walls.

### 4. Maze background
In order to enjoy the game more realistically, the background of the maze is composed of bushes.
